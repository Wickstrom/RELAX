This repository contains code for RELAX, a framework for representation learning explainability. RELAX is based on perturbation-based explainability and work by measuring the change in the representation space as parts of the input are masked out.

When should you use RELAX? If your output is a vector representation and you have no label information.

More information can be found in the paper: <b>Representation Learning Explainability </b><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-023-01773-2#citeas">(Wickstrøm et al., 2023)</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10161">(Wickstrøm et al., 2022)</a>

You can see RELAX used in practice in medical image retrieval in the paper: <b>A clinically motivated self-supervised approach for content-based image retrieval of CT liver images </b> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895611123000575">(Wickstrøm et al., 2023)</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04812">(Wickstrøm et al., 2022)</a>

## Installation

RELAX can be installed using pip as follows:

```setup
