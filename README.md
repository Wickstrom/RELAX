# RELAX: Representation Learning Explainability

- This repository contains code for RELAX, a framework for representation learning explainability. RELAX is based on perturbation-based explainability and work by measuring the change in the representation space as parts of the input are masked out.

- More information can be found in the paper: <b>Representation Learning Explainability </b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10161">(Wickstr√∏m et al., 2022)</a>
